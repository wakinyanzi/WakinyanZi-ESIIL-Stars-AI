## About Me
> *Oglala Lakota winyan hemaca na
makoce wakan kin He sapa heciyantanhan na Wakinyan Zi wicoti kinhan ka
Wakpamni Lake SD Unci Amelia Yellow Thunder el kichi emacage*
>
What I said in Lakota is:
I am an Oglala Lakota woman
I come from a sacred land called the Black Hills, where Yellow Thunder camp used to be. 
I was raised by grandmother Amelia Yellow Thunder in Wakpamni Lake, SD
>
I am a proud graduate of Oglala Lakota College, receiving my bachelors in Natural Science May 2020, as the pandemic began. My graduation ceremony was via Zoom link. 
I am pursuing my Masters in Natural Resource Management at South Dakota State University, Modeling Contaminant Transport for risk assessment in the Arikaree aquifer, the main source of water for the Oglala.

## *Wiconi Mitawa kin* (My Life)
> I am the mother of three beautiful adults, Laila, Ikeghe Luta, and Ivy Jade.
> I have one cat daughter named Katalina Inez, a cat son named Johnny Rotten Manafort Red Corn Cash Depp Yellow Thunder, and a dog son named Codey "python codes" Winkworth. I make my humble home with the love of my life Joshua.
> INSERT PICS OF THE BABIES AND ME AND JOSH HERE
> I am a maker at heart. My brain is scientist, my heart is making. I love to create pieces that Leksi Jhon Goes In Center calls, *"The art of personal adornment"*.
> I make to add pieces to my regalia but mostly to give away to family and friends. It is a Lakota lifeway to give and be thankful so I try to emanate that as much as possible.

## The Return of the AI
> It has been quite a journey as one of the first on the ESIIL program. Our first project was COVID - 19 data. Our lives were never the same. Last year we worked on church location data and filling archival gaps in our history on the reservation through this story. Again, my life was not the same after. I see these codes as a new way of bringing medicine to the Oyanke. We can adapt and evolve with these tools the same our ancestors adapted and evolved with new technology of their time. 
> 
> As an advanved intern, I am so excited to see the project ideas that the students will come up with. It is always so exciting when everyone catches on and the codes start looking pretty. I am looking forward to learning how to do more geospatial analysis in this coding world and getting more comfortable with utlizing it daily.
