> I have become extremely proficient with database engineering that is centered on Lakota lifeways and protocols. I have started to developed a unique metadata application that has created space for Wakan kin (the Elders), in their specified arenas of collective Earth Grandparenting and Custodianship, to translate and utilize complex scientific data sets. Implementing Lakota lifeways and returning to oral history has created a more conscientious methodology for conducting scientific studies in Lakota Territory and this is approach has altered the way I perform science back home, Wazi Ahanhan. I am eager to share what I am learning with the other Oyanke in Oceti Sakowin.
