What I said in Lakota is:
I am an Oglala Lakota woman
I come from a sacred land called the Black Hills, where Yellow Thunder camp used to be. 
I was raised by grandmother Amelia Yellow Thunder in Wakpamni Lake, SD
>
I am a proud graduate of Oglala Lakota College, receiving my bachelors in Natural Science May 2020, as the pandemic began. My graduation ceremony was via Zoom link. 
I am pursuing my Masters in Natural Resource Management at South Dakota State University, Modeling Contaminant Transport for risk assessment in the Arikaree aquifer, the main source of water for the Oglala.

> I have become extremely proficient with database engineering that is centered on Lakota lifeways and protocols. I have started to developed a unique metadata application that has created space for Wakan kin (the Elders), in their specified arenas of collective Earth Grandparenting and Custodianship, to translate and utilize complex scientific data sets. Implementing Lakota lifeways and returning to oral history has created a more conscientious methodology for conducting scientific studies in Lakota Territory and this is approach has altered the way I perform science back home, Wazi Ahanhan. I am eager to share what I am learning with the other Oyanke in Oceti Sakowin.
